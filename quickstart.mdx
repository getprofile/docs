## 1. Sign up & create your app

- Create your free account on our [website](https://getprofile-ai.com/register).
- From your [dashboard](https://getprofile-ai.com/dashboard), create an **app** (e.g., "My AI App").
- Each app has a unique **API key** — keep it secure!

## 2. Send your first profiling request

Use our `POST /api/v1/profile/{id}` endpoint to send structured or unstructured data for analysis.

Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.getprofile-ai.com/v1/profile/abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": "I love hiking and indie music.",
    "input_type": "conversation"
  }'
```

✅ You’ll get an immediate `202 Accepted` response while your data is processed in the background.

## 3. Retrieve the processed profile

Use our `GET /api/v1/profile/{id}` endpoint to get the structured profile data and a generated summary.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.getprofile-ai.com/v1/profile/abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You’ll receive:

- `profile`: Full structured profile data
- `summary`: AI-generated summary for LLM usage

## 4. Update profile over time

You can send new data to the same profile ID multiple times — GetProfile will merge and evolve the profile automatically!

✅ Profiles grow and adapt as you learn more about your users or characters.

For complete details on all endpoints and optional fields, see the [API Reference](/api-reference).
