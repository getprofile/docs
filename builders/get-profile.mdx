## What’s in a Profile?

A profile contains structured information extracted from your data:

- **core_info**: Basic info like name, age, gender, and location.
- **interests**: Categorized interests (music, hobbies, food, books, travel, etc.).
- **personality**: Traits and mood trends.
- **memories**: Key events or milestones.
- **preferences**: Conversation style and topics to avoid.
- **update_log**: Historical log of profile updates.
- **timestamps**: Last updated, created at, and per-section timestamps.
- **status**: `"processing"` or `"ready"` to indicate profile readiness.

Here’s a partial example:

```json
{
  "profile_id": "abc123",
  "status": "ready",
  "core_info": {
    "name": { "value": "Alex", "confidence": 0.95 },
    "location": { "value": "Berlin", "confidence": 0.9 }
  },
  "interests": {
    "hobbies": [
      { "value": "photography", "confidence": 0.9 },
      { "value": "hiking", "confidence": 0.85 }
    ],
    "music": [{ "value": "indie rock", "confidence": 0.9 }]
  },

}
```

## Searching & Summaries

- In the **dashboard**, you can search profiles by id.
- You’ll also receive a **generated summary** in the API response — ideal for LLMs or quick user overviews.

✅ **Profiles update automatically** as you send new data, adapting to evolving user or character contexts!
