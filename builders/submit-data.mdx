To create or update a user profile, send data to our API endpoint:

```http
POST /v1/profile/{profile_id}
```

## What to Send

- **profile_id**: A unique identifier for the profile (e.g., a user or character ID in your app).
- **data**: The raw text or structured data you want us to analyze.
- **input_type** _(optional)_: A short label describing the type of data (e.g., `"bio"`, `"conversation"`, `"activity_log"`, `"form"`). This can help with tracking and better profiling.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.getprofile-ai.com/v1/profile/abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": "Alex is a curious photographer from Berlin who loves indie music and hiking.",
    "input_type": "bio"
  }'
```

## Processing Model

- Your request is **accepted immediately** with a `202 Accepted` response.
- We process the data **asynchronously** in the background.
- When the processing is complete, the profile will be updated with the new insights.

This makes it easy to send data **continuously** â€” your profiles will evolve as new data comes in!

âœ… **No raw data is stored long-term** â€” only the structured profile is kept.
ðŸ”’ **Input data is deleted** once the profile update is complete.
