## Endpoint

```http
GET /v1/search
```

---

## Description

This endpoint **combines**:

- **Vector search** for semantic, natural language queries.
- **Classic search** for field-based filtering, sorting, and pagination.

You can use them **together** or **separately**. If a `query` is provided, **vector search** is used to find the most similar profiles to your text. If no `query` is provided, results are listed based on your filters and sorting.

## Query Parameters

| Parameter     | Type   | Default        | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query`       | string | —              | Natural language search text. If present, enables vector-based semantic search.                   |
| `sensitivity` | number | 63             | (Vector search only) Similarity threshold (0-100). Lower = more results; higher = stricter match. |
| `filterBy`    | string | —              | Field to filter by (`name`, `location`, `age`, `language`, `id`, etc.).                           |
| `filterValue` | string | —              | Value to filter for. Case-insensitive partial matching.                                           |
| `sortBy`      | string | `last_updated` | Field to sort by (`last_updated`, `created_at`, `id`, `name`, etc.).                              |
| `sortOrder`   | string | `desc`         | Sorting order: `asc` or `desc`.                                                                   |
| `page`        | number | 1              | Page number for pagination.                                                                       |
| `pageSize`    | number | 10             | Number of profiles per page.                                                                      |

## Behavior

### If `query` is provided:

- Uses **vector search** (AI embeddings) to find similar profiles.
- Results are always **ranked by similarity** (`similarityScore`).
- Classic sorting (`sortBy`) is ignored for vector search (limitation of vector search engines).

### If no `query` is provided:

- Classic search: results are filtered, sorted, and paginated as usual.

### If both `query` and filters are provided:

- Vector search results are **filtered** by `filterBy` and `filterValue` **after** vector search.
- Sorted by **similarity**.

## Example Request

```http
GET /v1/smart-search?query=experienced+data+scientist+with+PhD+looking+for+job&filterBy=location&filterValue=California&sortBy=last_updated&sortOrder=desc&page=1&pageSize=10
```

---

## Example Response

```json
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile_id": "abc123",
      "tenant_id": "tenant123",
      "status": "active",
      "core_info": {
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "location": "Helsinki",
        "age": 35,
        "language": "Finnish"
      },
      "last_updated": "2024-06-01T10:00:00Z",
      "created_at": "2023-05-10T15:30:00Z",
      "similarityScore": 0.92
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total": 10,
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 10
}
```

---

## Notes

- **Vector search** does **not support** custom `sortBy` fields—results are always sorted by `similarityScore` when `query` is used.
- If you need to sort vector search results by another field, consider **post-processing** in your application after fetching results.
- For **classic listing**, sorting works as expected for any `sortBy` field.

---

## Use Cases

- Discover profiles matching **natural language queries** like:

> “experienced data scientist with PhD looking for job”

- Filter results by **specific fields** like location or language.

- Paginate and load results seamlessly in your UI.

- Soon: create profile segments based on search results for targeted actions and campaigns.

## Conclusion

The **Smart Profiles Search API** is your single endpoint for **powerful, flexible profile discovery** — whether you’re listing profiles, doing semantic search, running marketing campaigns, or building internal tools.
