<Note>
**Zapier integration is currently in beta.**

Join the beta program and start using it by following [this link](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/225843/51140746d59c9141578eba38c7dc9046/).

</Note>

You can:

- Trigger actions in other apps when a profile is updated or created.
- Sync profile data to your CRM, marketing tools, or analytics platforms.
- Build complex workflows that react to real-time profile events.

## How It Works

- **Triggers**: When a profile is updated in GetProfile, Zapier triggers your workflow (Zap).
- **Actions**: Update, create or delete profiles directly from other apps.

### Example Use Cases

#### CRM Enrichment

Automatically add new profile insights to your CRM whenever a user’s profile updates.

#### Marketing Segmentation

Create targeted campaigns based on new hobbies, mood trends, or traits.

#### Internal Dashboards

Push profile updates to Notion, Airtable, or your internal tools for easy tracking.

## Security & API Key Management

- Your **API key** is required to connect GetProfile to Zapier.
- API keys can be rotated or revoked anytime from your dashboard.
- Only the data you share via Zapier triggers will be sent — no other profile data is exposed.
