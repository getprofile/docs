title: "Webhooks"
description: "Webhooks let you receive real-time notifications whenever important events happen in your GetProfile account or your tenant's profiles. Instead of polling the API, your app can respond immediately to changes."

With webhooks, you can:

- Keep your app’s database in sync with GetProfile
- Trigger custom workflows in real-time
- Monitor profile updates or billing events instantly

## How It Works

When an event occurs (like a profile update), GetProfile makes an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL you configured for your tenant. This request includes a JSON payload describing the event.

Your server should respond with a 200 OK status to acknowledge receipt.

## Example Webhook Event

Here’s an example of a profile.updated event:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_1234567890",
  "event": "profile.updated",
  "tenant_id": "abc-tenant",
  "data": {
    "profile_id": "12345",
    "status": "ready"
  },
  "created_at": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
  "webhook_id": "webhook_12345"
}
```

## Available Events

| Event             | Description                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `profile.updated` | Sent when a profile’s data changes |

## Configuring Webhooks

1. In your [GetProfile dashboard](https://getprofile-ai.com), navigate to `Webhooks`.
2. Click "Create webhook" button, enter the URL of your webhook endpoint (e.g., https://yourapp.com/webhooks/getprofile).
3. Save the configuration.

You can update, turn off or delete the webhook at any time.

## Handling Webhook Requests

Your webhook endpoint should:

- Accept `POST` requests with `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Parse the JSON payload.
- Validate the request using the `Authorization` header.
- Respond with 200 OK quickly.
- Process the event asynchronously if needed.

### Example in Node.js Express

```javascript
app.post("/webhooks/getprofile", express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers["authorization"];

  if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
    return res
      .status(401)
      .send("Unauthorized: Missing or invalid Authorization header");
  }

  const incomingSecret = authHeader.split(" ")[1];

  if (incomingSecret !== process.env.GETPROFILE_API_KEY) {
    return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized: Invalid webhook secret");
  }

  const event = req.body;
  console.log("Received webhook event:", event);

  // TODO: process event here

  res.status(200).send("OK");
});
```

## Security Best Practices

- Only accept requests from trusted sources.
- Validate the `Authorization` header before processing the event.
- Use HTTPS for your endpoint.
- Respond quickly (under 5 seconds) to avoid retries.
