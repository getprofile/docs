<Note>**Model Context Protocol (MCP) is coming soon!**</Note>

We are excited to announce that GetProfile will soon support a Model Context Protocol (MCP) for our API. This will allow you to integrate real-time profile data directly into your LLM-powered tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, or custom AI agents.

---

### What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a secure, structured interface that allows AI assistants and LLM tools (like Claude, GPT-4, or LangChain agents) to **access external data sources** — in this case, the GetProfile API.

This lets your AI workflows pull **live profile data** (like interests, traits, and updates) directly from your tenant’s profiles in real time.

---

### Setting Up MCP with Claude Desktop (or other tools)

Follow these steps to connect Claude Desktop (or any MCP-compatible app) to our MCP server:

---

#### Install Claude Desktop

Download and install Claude Desktop from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download).

---

#### Access Developer Settings

- Open Claude Desktop.
- Click on the **Claude** menu in the top bar.
- Select **Settings**.
- Go to the **Developer** tab.
- Click **Edit Config** to open the configuration file.

---

#### Configure the MCP Server

In the `claude_desktop_config.json` file, add our **GetProfile MCP server** configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "getprofile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mint-mcp add docs.getprofile-ai.com"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your tenant’s **API key** from the GetProfile dashboard.

✅ **Tip:** You can add multiple MCP servers if needed (like local filesystem, etc.).

---

#### 4️⃣ Restart Claude Desktop

Save your changes and restart Claude Desktop to activate the new MCP server configuration.

---

### Using MCP Tools with Claude

Once configured:

✅ Open a new conversation in Claude Desktop.
✅ Click the **Tools** icon in the chat window.
✅ You’ll see the **GetProfile MCP tool** available.
✅ You can now ask Claude to **fetch live profile data** using your tenant’s API key.

For example:

> “Show me Alex’s hobbies and mood.”

Claude will:
1️⃣ Identify the GetProfile MCP tool.
2️⃣ Request permission to use it.
3️⃣ Fetch the real-time profile data.
4️⃣ Provide the result in your conversation.

---

### 🔒 Security Considerations

- Claude (or any AI assistant) **asks for your permission** before running MCP tools.
- You can grant access **once** or for the entire conversation.
- Review each request to ensure you’re comfortable with the data shared.

---

### Troubleshooting

✅ Verify your **API key** is correct.
✅ Ensure you **restarted Claude Desktop** after configuration.
✅ Check that **Node.js and npx** are installed (`npx` is bundled with Node).
✅ If you see errors, review Claude’s logs for details.

---

### 🔗 Using with Other MCP-Compatible Tools

The GetProfile MCP server works with **any tool** that supports the Model Context Protocol — not just Claude Desktop.

Configuration steps may vary depending on the app, but the **core usage remains the same**:

- Point to the MCP server package
- Pass your **API key**
- Use live profile data in your LLM workflows!
