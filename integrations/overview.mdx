## Custom GPTs & OpenAI Assistants

Bring profiling data directly into your custom GPTs or Assistants:

- Use REST API to create tools for custom GPTs.
- Inject dynamic personality and preference data to create more natural and tailored conversations.

[See API reference](/api-reference) for details on how to use GetProfile REST API with OpenAI tools.

## Model Context Provider (MCP)

GetProfile also works as an MCP-compatible API, making it easy to integrate with modern AI platforms and assistants:

- Provide LLMs and other agents with up-to-date user profiles.

[Use our hosted MCP server](/integrations/mcp) for seamless tool integration.

## No-Code Tools: FlowXO, n8n & Make

Integrate GetProfile with powerful no-code automation platforms:

- **n8n**: Use HTTP request nodes to connect to GetProfile’s API and process profiles as part of larger workflows.
- **Make (formerly Integromat)**: Fetch profiles or send updates to create automations across your favorite apps.
- **FlowXO**: Use HTTP triggers and actions to connect GetProfile with your FlowXO bots and workflows.

No-code or low-code? No problem — GetProfile adapts to your stack.

## Other Ideas

GetProfile also works with:

- **Salesforce / HubSpot / CRMs**: Enrich customer data with structured profiles.
- **Game engines / Unity / Unreal / Godot**: Create dynamic character or player profiles in real time.
