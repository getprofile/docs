Your API key is the **gateway** to your app's profiling data and must be handled with care.

---

## What is an API Key?

Each app in GetProfile has a unique **API key** that:

- Authenticates your requests
- Enforces your usage quotas and plan limits
- Segregates your data from other apps

---

## Best Practices

- **Keep it secret!** Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control.
- **Use environment variables** to store your API key securely in your applications.
- **Rotate keys** periodically for added security — you can do this from your dashboard.

Example for a secure environment variable in a `.env` file:

```plaintext
GETPROFILE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then, access it in your code:

In Python:

```python
import os
api_key = os.getenv('GETPROFILE_API_KEY')
```

In Node.js:

```js
const apiKey = process.env.GETPROFILE_API_KEY;
```

## Rotating or Revoking API Keys

- Go to your **API Keys** page in the dashboard.
- Use the **rotate** button to generate a new API key — the old one will stop working immediately.
- If you suspect your key has been exposed, **revoke** it right away.

---

## Where is the API Key used?

Your API key must be included in the `Authorization` header for every API request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Example `curl` request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.getprofile-ai.com/v1/profile/abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

---

## Lost your API key?

No worries! Just **rotate** it in the dashboard to generate a fresh one. Your existing integrations will need to be updated with the new key.
