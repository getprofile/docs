## How it works

Each app in your account has a unique API key. This key identifies your app and ensures that only you can access and modify your data.

- **Keep your API key secure**
- **Rotate keys in your dashboard if needed**
- **Use different keys for different apps or environments**

---

## Adding the API key to requests

You must include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

For example:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.getprofile-ai.com/v1/profile/abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Where to find your API key

1. Log in to your Dashboard.
2. Go to the API Keys page.
3. Copy the API key for the app you want to integrate.

If your API key is compromised, rotate it from the dashboard to protect your data.

## Tips for API key usage

- Never commit your API key to public repositories.
- Use environment variables (process.env.YOUR_API_KEY) in your backend for secure usage.
- Periodically review and rotate keys to maintain security.

For more details on secret keys see the [API Keys](/builders/api-keys) documentation.
